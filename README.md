# Crystals Collector

Can you figure out the value of each crystal?

## Instructions

The Crystals Collector game can be accessed [here](https://avscott562.github.io/unit-4-game/).  In this game, the computer will randomly select a score to start the game.  The four crystals will have values randomly assigned to them as well.  These values will not display on the screen initially.  When you click the crystal, the value will be displayed on the screen as an addition to the score.  Your goal is to figure out the value of each crystal and match the computer's score.  If you match the score, you win.  If you go over the computer's score, you lose.
